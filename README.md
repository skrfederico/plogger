# Plogger (Phonecalls Log App) 

## Description

Communication between parents and teachers is a key part for the educational success of young students. This app registers all the important information taken from every conversation between staff and families.

## The end goal

To make the access, manipulation and follow up of phone conversation registers easier for both educators and parents of students.

## Background info 

The creation of this app was inspired by the fruits app modeled for students of SEIR Flex at GA and my personal experience managing a school of languages in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Features

- Index Page

  - The main page is an index page that renders all of the phonecall logs organized in a chronological way.

- Detailed cards

  - Each 'plog' contains detailed information about the phonecall, names of all the parts involved, dates, reason for calling and a visual aid to easily identify which entries need a follow up.

- Nav bar

  - A header navigation bar with links to General Assembly webpage, Hedwig's cohort heroku webpage, a "new vlog" option to create a new entry and a search bar to help the user find specific 'plogs' using keywords.
